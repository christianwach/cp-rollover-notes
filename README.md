CommentPress Rollover Footnotes
===============================

The CommentPress Rollover Footnotes plugin enables rollover footnotes in the content of a page or post. It is based on [jQuery Tooltip](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/), which is included in the plugin directory.

Example footnote link:

```html
<a class="note" href="#note1">[1]</a>
```

Example footnote structure:

```html
<ol class="notes" start="0">
<li class="notes-header"><h3>Footnotes</h3></li>
<li id="note1">This is what the pop-up footnotes look like. If you find a note that runs off the top or the bottom of the page, scroll the main window a bit and you should be able to make the entire thing appear.</li>
</ol>
```
